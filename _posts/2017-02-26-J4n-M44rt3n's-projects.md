# J4n-M44rt3n's BioHack Academy 4 Documentation

Hi! My name is Jan-Maarten, but since this name was already taken on GitHub, I go by J4n-M44rt3n. Below you will find documentation of various adventures during BioHack Academy 4.
#
**Tube Rack**

Say, you ran out of racks for your favorite 20 mm diameter test tubes, but you do have some 3mm sheet and a lasercutter around. Here you will find a design to help you out. This design features optimized (staggered!) hole placement, a suspended floor plate for extra stability and easy tube manipulation, and handles to help you move the rack around. Bonus feature: holes to wire a string and create an additional handle.#

**Sterile Hood**

This is an adaptation of the BioHack Academy 4 sterile hood. It features the same Ikea embedded fan, hepa filter, and pre-filter; but a novel hood. this hood needs to be placed on a sterile surface and keeps a clear acrylic sheet between your hands and your head. No more breathing on your tiny invisible friends! I printed custom hepa filter holders and also added two extra feet on the Ikea part for stability.

**Slime mold arena**

The slime mold is a remarkable creature, showing intelligent behavior in the absence of a nervous system. As such, many researchers believe it can get bored and in fact it will often try to escape its enclosure looking for adventure. I designed a home that will make it easy to keep the slime mold in your life entertained, while also making it unattractive for it to wander off.

The enclosure is elevated and transparant, so you can slip pieces of paper underneath and distribute treats on the floor of the enclosure according to the markings on your paper. Your slime mold will now try to make sense of your message by connecting the dots. Some say it will do this as an artistic reflection on its place in the universe. This I consider conjecture, as an advanced being such as the slime mold surely realizes Self is defined in its relation to Other, and not by engaging in solipsist noodling.

The stage for its explorations is floating on a solidified bed of agar and salt, which it will be reluctant to cross. The lid will help maintain a damp microclimate, while keeping potential predators out. The lid has a grated opening to allow some exchange of fresh and moldy air.

**Winogradsky enclosure with temperature gradient**

Most micro-organisms live in complex ecological networks. The Winogradsky jar is one of the few tools available to study such networks. A Winogradsky jar is a sealed container in which a micro-organism-rich sample has been scooped, along with optional added ingredients. Under gravity, and in interaction with each other, the micro-organisms often will self-organize in distinct layers that feed on each others waste products.

To experimentally study such networks, I will add peltier modules to the sides of a rectangular Winogradsky jar (an adapted airtight, transparant food container). In this way, a temperature gradient can be introduced at a ninety degree angle relative to gravityÂ´s vector. On top I will add two extra lids to facilitate sampling.
